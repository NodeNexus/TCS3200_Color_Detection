**Introduction**                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The TCS3200 color sensor is a versatile module that can detect and measure the intensity of light across the visible spectrum. When paired with an Arduino, it enables color detection and identification by measuring the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components of light reflected from a surface.                                                                                                                                                          

This repository provides Arduino sketch examples and wiring diagrams to help you get started with using the TCS3200 sensor for color detection in your own projects.

Upload the Arduino sketch (Arduino_Color_Detection.ino) provided in the arduino_code directory to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

**Calibration:**                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Adjust sensor settings such as integration time and gain in the Arduino sketch to calibrate the sensor for accurate color detection in your specific environment.
Open the Arduino_Color_Detection.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
Open the Serial Monitor to view the RGB values detected by the TCS3200 sensor.

**Interpreting Output:**
The RGB values printed in the Serial Monitor represent the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue light detected by the sensor.
Use these values to determine the color of an object or surface in front of the sensor.
