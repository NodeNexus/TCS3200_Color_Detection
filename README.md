## 📝 Introduction  
The **TCS3200 color sensor** is a versatile module that can detect and measure the intensity of light across the visible spectrum. When paired with an Arduino, it enables **color detection and identification** by measuring the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components of light reflected from a surface.  

This repository provides:  
- Arduino sketch examples  
- Wiring diagrams  
- Calibration steps  

to help you get started with using the TCS3200 sensor in your own projects.

## 🔌 Hardware Setup  
Connect the TCS3200 sensor to your Arduino board as follows:  

| TCS3200 Pin | Arduino Pin |  
|-------------|-------------|  
| S0          | 8           |  
| S1          | 9           |  
| S2          | 10          |  
| S3          | 11          |  
| OUT         | 12          |

## ⚙️ Installation  
1. Open the Arduino IDE  
2. Load the sketch from the `arduino_code/Arduino_Color_Detection.ino` file  
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board  

---

## 🎛 Calibration  
To calibrate the sensor:  
1. Adjust **integration time** and **gain** in the sketch  
2. Upload the sketch again  
3. Open the **Serial Monitor** to view RGB values detected by the TCS3200  

---

## 📊 Interpreting Output  
- The Serial Monitor displays RGB values (intensity of Red, Green, Blue)  
- These values represent the color detected by the sensor  
- You can use them for:  
  - Identifying object colors  
  - Sorting items by color  
  - Robotics and IoT projects  

---

## 🧪 Example Projects  
- **Object Color Identification** – detect and print object color names  
- **Sorting Mechanism** – separate items based on detected color  
- **Smart Lighting** – control LED color based on detected surface color
